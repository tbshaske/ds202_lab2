Question Set (Individual)
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
hist(choco$Rating)
```
1. The ratings appear slightly left skewed. The most common ratings are between 2.5 and 3.0, and between 3.0 and 3.5. There are approximately 600 chocolates with a rating between 2.5 and 3.0, approximately 800 chocolates witha rating between 3.0 and 3.5. There are no chocolates with a rating between 4.0 and 4.5. Outliers would be chocolates with a rating between 4.5 and 5.0. 

```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
cor(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```
2. According to the scatterplot and the correlation coefficient, it does not appear that there is a linear relationship between the rating and the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar.
