1.The ratings on the histogram appear to be left-skewed only slightly between 2.5 and 3.Outliers are between 4.5 and 5.
```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
cor(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```
2. Looking at the scatterplot, it does not appear that there is a correlation between Cocoa Percentage and the Rating. There is no linear relationship.
